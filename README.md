## 3. Traffic lights - with only one 3 pin LED

3 pin LED are specific LED, which can show 3 different colors based on the inputs. The middle pin is negative.

Because I did not have a proper resistor, it turns out, I burnt this one after some time of usage... :(

## A little theory 

**LED diode:**

The longer one is the anode, shorter one is the cathode. If you switch the wires, it will just not work.   
#### How to connect LED diode to Arduino?  
We're always connecting the cathode (-) to the GND.

I was working without resistors (because I did not have a proper one xD), but that affects the lifetime of the LED. 
<br/><br/>
Once you put the input into one hole on Arduino ***breadboard***, then vertically that side of the breadboard has that input. Check the colored rectangles.
